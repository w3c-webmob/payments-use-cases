Use Cases and Requirements for Web Payments on Mobile
==================

This document outlines the use cases and requirements for payments on mobile. The use cases and requirements were gathered by gathering data on web and native applications with payment functionality, as well as looking at native payment platforms. 


## Motivation
The main questions this document seeks to expore are:
* What functionality is being achieved by native payment applications and platforms which is missing from the web?
* What functionality is being offered through proprietary plugins to the web for payments?
* What methods of payments are being offered to users through these other methods of payments?

On March 24-25 the W3C will hold a [Workshop on Web Payments](http://www.w3.org/2013/10/payments/Overview.html). We have been asked to submit our use cases to help define the work the W3C will do on web payments in the future.
